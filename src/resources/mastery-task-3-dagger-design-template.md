## Mastery Task 3 Dagger Design Template

### Analyze `App.java`

Looking through `App.java` and your class diagram, identify:

1. Which classes should be returned from the Dagger component

2. Which classes have constructors that should be annotated with `@Inject`
3. Which objects will we have to provide in a Provider method in a Module class.
   **Recall**: *Java annotations are ways to provide additional information
   to code that can be used during compilation or runtime, such as `@Override`,
   `@Test`, or `@Mock`. The action of adding an annotation is called "annotating".*

When identifying the classes, think about:
1. Which classes only **have** dependencies on other classes, i.e. the
   "root" classes that we interact with at the top of our service. 

2. Which classes only **are** dependencies of other classes, but have
   no dependencies of their own

3. Which classes both **are** dependencies of other classes and **have**
   dependencies on other classes

Remember that:
1. "Root" classes should be provided using Dagger's `Component` interface,
   and should have their constructors annotated with `@Inject`.
1. All of the root classes' dependencies should either:
   1. have constructors annotated with `@Inject`
   1. **or** be provided in Provider methods of Module classes that can
      be registered to Dagger's `Component` interface.
1. If there are relevant Singleton classes, Dagger's `Component` interface
   should also be annotated `@Singleton`

### Capture Your Analysis

List the class(es) that `App.java` provides that are **not** dependencies of other classes, that is, no other classes
 in the project depend on these classes

* CreatePlaylistActivity
* GetPlaylistActivity
* UpdatePlaylistActivity
* AddSongToPlaylistActivity
* GetPlaylistSongsActivity

List the class(es) that `App.java` provides that **are** dependencies of other classes

* DynamoDBMapper
* PlaylistDao
* AlbumTrackDao


List the class(es) that `App.java` creates that have constructors we must annotate with `@Inject`

* PlaylistDao
* AlbumTrackDao
* CreatePlaylistActivity
* PlaylistDao
* UpdatePlaylistActivity
* AddSongToPlaylistActivity
* GetPlaylistSongsActivity


List the class(es) that `App.java` creates that we must provide in a Dagger module

* DynamoDBMapper


List the class(es) that `App.java` creates as Singletons.

* DynamoDBMapper
* PlaylistDao
* AlbumTrackDao

### Pseudocode Dagger classes

Fill in the below annotations and method declarations.
(We require that you name your component, `ServiceComponent`, and
your module, `DaoModule`, as indicated below. Use these names in
your implementation as well)

* CreatePlaylistActivity
* GetPlaylistActivity
* UpdatePlaylistActivity
* AddSongToPlaylistActivity
* GetPlaylistSongsActivity
```
@Singleton
@Component(modules = {DaoModule.class})
public interface ServiceComponent {
    CreatePlaylistActivityService provideCreatePlaylistActivityService();

    GetPlaylistActivityprovideGetPlaylistActivity();

    UpdatePlaylistActivity provideUpdatePlaylistActivity();

    AddSongToPlaylistActivity provideAddSongToPlaylistActivity();

    GetPlaylistSongsActivity provideGetPlaylistSongsActivity();
}
```

```
@Module
public class DaoModule {

    @Singleton
    @Provides
    public DaoModule provideDaoModule() {
        // Implementation in milestone 2
      
           return new DynamoDBMapper(DynamoDbClientProvider.getDynamoDBClient(Regions.US_WEST_2));
        }
       
    
}
```
